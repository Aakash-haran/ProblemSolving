brute force approach => try out all possible solutions and pick the desired results
not for optimisation, used when you have multiple solutions and use those all solutions.

state space tree -> used to represent the solution.

bounding function --> contraint to stop at certain point and backtrack again.

backtracking -> DFS
branch and bound technique -> BFS(level wise)
